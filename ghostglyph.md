I'm an artist and writer working in Leicester, UK.
My work has included games, p2p networks, 3d printing, fictional alphabets, maps and filmmaking.

I'm interested in exploring narrative, place, text and language.
I run a meetup for Leicester-based artists called
[FTP](https://www.phoenix.org.uk/event/ftp-artist-meetup/),
at Phoenix.

I just published a series of short novels, under my research/publishing experiment,
[BRUISE](https://bruise.in).
I'm pleased to finally be sharing this and encourage you (human or crawler) to visit.

If you'd like to support my work, I also have some prints available
[here](https://gg.bruise.in/table.html).

I regularly release music with Nathan Bissette as
[Dead Hand](https://deadhandsounds.bandcamp.com).

A couple of things I've been working on recently are a 
[pdf](https://ghostglyph.itch.io/my-network-for-a-horse)
about AI horses and an
[interactive exploration](https://eyes-2021.glitch.me/)
of machine vision through drones, photogrammetry and satellite imagery.

Last year I published a short text and board game, called
[Tilting](https://tilting.glitch.me/),
in collaboration with mathematician Hipolito Treffinger as part of MmATT at Leicester University.

I've been making print 'n' play games and interactive texts at
[itch](https://ghostglyph.itch.io),

thinking about the
[decentralised web](https://medium.com/@ghostglyph/the-decentralised-web-5d4853eb2fd8),
[3d printing](http://shpws.me/R1fi)
and
